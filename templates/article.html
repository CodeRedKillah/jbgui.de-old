        &nbsp;
        <p> If you're looking to jailbreak with Electra, you must know that it uses <a>Substitute</a> instead of <a>Substrate</a> and requires you to use <a href="https://jbgui.de/packagemanagers/sileo">Sileo</a> over <a>Cydia.</a>&nbsp;</p>
        &nbsp;

        <br>
        <p>We recommend you use <a href="https://jbgui.de/unc0ver">unc0ver</a> on iOS 11 because it has advantages over
          Electra. Those advantages include more kernel <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploit_(computer_security)">exploits</a>, descriptive errors, more
          settings, and a log.<br>
          <br>
          If you choose unc0ver, you have two options. unc0ver by pwn20wnd, or unc0ver dark, a fork of unc0ver made by
          Diatrus and Shady. For a comparison of the two, refer to <a href="https://jbgui.de/unc0ver/#comparison">our
            unc0ver guide.</a><br>

          This is the preferred method of installing jailbreak apps onto one's device, but
          there is a method to do it without a computer if needed. If you <em>have</em> a computer, then read on.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>To get started, you'll need to install <a>Cydia Impactor</a> on your
          computer. Simply click the link and install it like any other program. Next, you will need the ipa for Electra
          from <a href="https://coolstar.org/electra">Coolstar's website.</a> Once you have it downloaded, plug your device into your computer, open
          Impactor and check if your device is seen. It should show as <code>&lt;Device Name&gt; [&lt;UUID&gt;]</code>.</p>
        <br>
        <p> Then, go to the menu and choose Device --&gt; Install Package. A file browser should open. Select the ipa for Electra, then follow the instructions. If you run into any errors after entering your Apple ID, read <a href="https://jbgui.de/other/software/impactor">our page</a> on Impactor.</p>

        <p class="article-subtitle">Installation (without computer)</p>
        <br>
        <p class="article-text"><b>Note: This method is only successful when a signing service has a valid
            certificate.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="article-text">On your apple device, navigate to <a href="https://jailbreaks.fun">jailbreaks.fun</a> in Safari. Scroll down untill you find Electra1141. Tap on it, then press the blue "GET" button. <br>
          <br>
          After waiting a few seconds a popup should appear asking you if you want to install it. Press install. In a few seconds the app should be on your home screen. <br>
  <br>
          Before you open it, open settings, go to General --&gt; Profiles &amp; Device Management and tap the developer under the heading "ENTERPRISE APP".&nbsp; Press the blue trust button, and you should now be able to open the app.<br>
  <br>
          Before pressing the jailbreak button, We recommend closing all other apps and turning off WiFI and Cellular Data to increase the success rate of the jailbreak.<br>
